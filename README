MOlympics : A Jquery Experiment for a Mobile Application feeding RSS from the Official Olympics Game Website

THe section now createde are Blog and News
The basic construction is based on PHP , XML , HTML and JQuery Mobile technologies

Our recipe:

Jquery Mobile is included on the index.php file that works like a framework .
Header and Footer are included inside the main index.php file
Main.php section is the one that actually contains a feed parser that read th exml and create a html output
The HTML is rendered thorugh JQuery Mobile and served as application

Still need obviosuly a lot of implementation
